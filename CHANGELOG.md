# Changelog

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Harness AI Chat**: Native chat panel powered by Harness Intelligence — streaming responses, full markdown rendering, session history (search, rename, delete), interactive elicitation cards (YAML confirm, free text, select, multi-select, forms), MCP connector status pill, and a pipeline-context chip that auto-follows the execution you're viewing
- **AI footer split launcher**: Harness AI is the primary destination in the sidebar footer; external tools (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor) are one click away via the dropdown
- **Worker-agent chat viewer**: AI agent pipeline steps open in a dedicated side-by-side chat tab with tool-call summaries
- **Execution list overhaul**: Uniform row layout, server-side pagination with **Load more**, rolling time-range filter (defaults to last 24 hours), status-colored run tiles, and **SEC** module chip from execution summary

### Changed
- Enhanced sidebar theme uses a **fixed Harness palette** instead of IDE CSS variables — consistent look across VS Code, Cursor, and custom themes
- Compact flat header with org/project inline; refreshed filter toolbar (two-row layout with color-coded status dots)
- UI enhancements

### Fixed
- OPA policy tooltip clipping, Deploy tab environment links, and detail-tab click-through
- Light-theme contrast for logos and app menu selection
- Execution time-range filter respected after navigating away and back; rolling windows instead of calendar-period enums
- Running duration display (`m:ss`), long execution name truncation, and skeleton loading layout shift

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Re-run pipeline**: Re-run a finished execution with its original inputs via the retry API (inputSet YAML + first-stage `retryStages` + `runAllStages`); confirmation dialog and auto-navigation to the new execution
- **Abort execution**: Abort a running pipeline with interrupt-type selection (Abort All / Mark as Failed); the action button adapts to execution status
- **Build tab**: Repository, branch (and PR), commits, and published image/SBOM artifacts — parsed from `moduleInfo.ci`
- **Deploy tab**: Per CD stage services (with manifests), environments, and skip reasons — parsed from `layoutNodeMap`
- **Security tab**: STO scanner results with per-severity tiles and new-vulnerability deltas, parsed from the execution graph (no extra API call)
- Instant hover tooltips + highlight on re-run/abort buttons, step "View step logs" arrows, and the policy-evaluation link

### Changed
- Publisher identifier set to `harness-inc` (marketplace ID `harness-inc.harness-vscode`)

### Fixed
- **Pipeline re-run** was returning errors — fixed by using the correct retry endpoint (`POST /pipeline/api/pipeline/execute/retry/{pipelineIdentifier}` with `planExecutionId` in the query), passing the original execution's inputSet YAML, resolving the YAML stage identifier from the `retryStages` API, and reading the new execution ID from `data.planExecution.uuid`
- Re-run/abort no longer strand the detail view on "loading" — poller queues a `pendingRefresh` when a refresh is requested mid-tick, and keeps actively polling a freshly-created execution that is not yet queryable (404 window)
- Aborted/terminal status now renders immediately instead of waiting for the render throttle
- A poller created after an org/project switch is seeded with current sidebar visibility, so it no longer skips every tick (re-run/abort failing to update after switching projects)
- Native button tooltips that never appeared (destroyed by ~2s re-renders) replaced with instant CSS tooltips; re-run/abort button re-enables after cancel/error

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Authentication isolation**: Prevents credential conflicts when both environment variables and PAT are configured
  - Added `getAuthSource()` validation that verifies env vars are present before using 'env' mode
  - Strict isolation in `getConfig()`: 'env' mode uses ONLY environment variables, 'pat' mode uses ONLY secret store + settings
  - No more fallback mixing between auth sources
  - Fixes 401 "Token is not valid" error when environment variables from Account A interfere with PAT for Account B
  - Added defensive token trimming in `SecretStore.getApiKey()` to handle whitespace issues

### Changed
- **Marketplace readiness**: Prepared extension for VS Code Marketplace publication
  - Added keywords for discoverability (harness, ci/cd, pipelines, devops, continuous integration, continuous deployment, logs, testing, approvals, monitoring)
  - Added categories: Other, Visualization, Testing
  - Added gallery banner with Harness brand color (#00ADE4, dark theme)
  - Added Q&A link pointing to GitHub issues
  - Added `vscode:prepublish` script for automatic build before publishing
  - Cleaned up README.md for marketplace audience (removed VSIX instructions)
  - Created CONTRIBUTING.md with developer setup, build, and release instructions

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Automatic account ID extraction from PAT**: No more manual account ID entry during setup
  - Extracts account ID from PAT token format (`pat.<accountId>.<userId>.<random>`)
  - Verifies credentials with API call before proceeding
  - Falls back to manual entry if extraction fails or token format doesn't match
  - Reduces onboarding from 3 steps to 2 steps for most users
- **GitHub Copilot integration**: Full support for GitHub Copilot Chat alongside Claude Code and Cursor
  - Auto-detects GitHub Copilot extension (only in VS Code, not Cursor)
  - GitHub Copilot icon in AI bar when detected
  - MCP configuration with correct paths:
    - Local (project): `.vscode/mcp.json`
    - Global: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\Code\User\mcp.json` (Windows), `~/.config/Code/User/mcp.json` (Linux)
  - Uses `"servers"` key instead of `"mcpServers"` (Copilot-specific format)
  - Environment variable inheritance: When using env var auth, only includes org/project IDs in config (API key inherited from VS Code process)
  - PAT mode includes all credentials explicitly in MCP config
  - Auto-paste integration: Opens Copilot Chat and pastes prompt automatically
- **AI bar enabled by default**: AI integration now defaults to ON if FME flag evaluation fails
  - Provides better fail-safe experience
  - Only disabled when FME explicitly returns 'off'
  - Ensures AI features are always available unless intentionally turned off

### Fixed
- **Workspace settings error**: Fixed "Unable to write to Workspace Settings" error when no workspace is open
  - Added workspace existence checks before updating workspace settings
  - Applied to `runWorkspaceSetup()`, `runEnvVarOnboarding()`, and `resetConfiguration` command
  - Prevents errors during onboarding without an open workspace
- **Cursor detection**: Fixed undefined variable reference in Cursor detector
  - Changed `cursorDir` to `cursorBaseDir` in return statement
  - Cursor now appears correctly in AI bar
- **Environment variable authentication with MCP**: MCP configuration now respects auth source
  - When using env vars (`authSource === 'env'`), MCP config writes `${HARNESS_API_KEY}` placeholders
  - When using PAT, MCP config includes actual credentials
  - API key resolution checks env vars first, falls back to secret store

### Changed
- **Cross-platform MCP paths**: Updated MCP configuration paths for all platforms
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude.json` (all platforms)
  - Cursor (macOS/Linux): `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Cursor (Windows): `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\mcp.json`
  - GitHub Copilot: Platform-specific paths as listed above
- **MCP path display in UI**: Dynamically shows correct paths based on selected AI tool
  - Claude Code: Shows `.mcp.json` (project) or `~/.claude.json` (global)
  - GitHub Copilot: Shows `.vscode/mcp.json` (project) or OS-specific paths (global)
  - Tip text updated for Copilot project scope: "Lives in .vscode/ folder"

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- **Export command**: Fixed export not working when viewing history detail executions
  - Reordered message handler to process HISTORY_DETAIL before EXECUTION_UPDATE
  - Prevents EXECUTION_UPDATE from overwriting history detail source
  - Execution data now updates while keeping history source intact
- **Looping strategy visualization**: Fixed looped stages not displaying all iterations
  - Changed getStages() to track by execution ID instead of nodeUuid
  - Now shows all iterations (e.g., GitOps Dev_movie, GitOps Dev_booking) separately
  - Each iteration displays its own steps and status
- **Switch project button**: Fixed button appearing to do nothing when clicked
  - Now clears workspace-specific org/project settings before saving global selection
  - Workspace settings take precedence over global, so they must be cleared first

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Configurable Claude CLI timeout**: New `harness.claudeCliTimeoutSeconds` setting
  - Default: 90s (range: 30-600s)
  - Allows users to increase timeout for complex AI queries requiring many API calls
  - Applied only to Claude CLI subprocess execution (cursor/extension tools unaffected)
- **VS Code Output panel logging**: Centralized logging system with user control
  - All logs now appear in dedicated "Harness" channel (View → Output → Harness)
  - Removed 220+ console.* calls to Developer Tools
  - Timestamp and component prefixes for better readability
  - FME Split.io SDK debug logs now respect `harness.logLevel` setting

### Fixed
- **Streaming ZIP parser for step logs**: Properly handles data descriptors in streaming ZIP files
  - Fixes garbled/unreadable logs for Gitleaks, Wiz SAST, and similar security scanning steps
  - Scans for data descriptor signature (0x08074b50) when compSize=0 in local file header
  - Calculates actual compressed size by locating descriptor or next entry
  - Skips past data descriptor (12 or 16 bytes) after processing each entry
  - Preserves compatibility with standard ZIP files (EOCD-based)
- **UI state management during log fetch**: Loading states now update correctly
  - Added render() calls after STEP_LOGS_LOADING, STEP_LOGS_EMPTY, and STEP_LOGS_OPENED_IN_TAB messages
  - Loading spinner displays immediately when clicking a step
  - Proper "No logs available" state instead of stale content
  - Shows "✓ Logs opened in editor tab" confirmation
- **ANSI escape codes in logs**: Removes color codes and control characters for clean display
  - Created utils/ansiStrip.ts utility to strip ANSI sequences
  - Removes standard ANSI codes (\x1b[...m), OSC sequences, character sets, malformed UTF-8
  - Applied in logEditorTab.ts before rendering in editor tabs

### Changed
- Cleaned up verbose debug logging throughout logService.ts for production readiness
- Logger now initialized with OutputChannel in extension.ts activation
- "Harness: Show Debug Output" and "Harness: Debug FME Flags" commands reference Output panel

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-09

  - Fixed scheduling logic to keep polling active when detail executions are running
  - Prevented 25-second UI freezes when fetching step logs (now non-blocking)
  - Fixed FME SDK callbacks creating race conditions (now run in background)
  - Fixed log editor tabs stealing sidebar focus and pausing updates (preserveFocus: true)
  - Fixed poller stopping when no matching live execution found (early return scheduling bug)

### Changed
- **Optimized GIT_CONTEXT messaging**: Reduced from every-second spam to only-on-change
  - Extracted to `sendGitContext()` method, only called when git/config/FME changes
  - Removes unnecessary webview re-renders and console noise
- **Removed automatic log streaming**: Logs now fetched only on-demand when user clicks a step
  - Reduces API calls and network traffic
  - Logs still available instantly via on-demand fetch with editor tab display
