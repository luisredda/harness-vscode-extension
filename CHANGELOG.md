# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-08

- **First-run onboarding empty state**: Beautiful setup UI for new users
  - Shows 3-step preview (Base URL, Personal Access Token, Account ID) before configuration

  - Consistent "Personal Access Token" terminology throughout onboarding
- **Smart polling optimization**: Significant reduction in API calls and resource usage
  - Pauses polling when Harness sidebar is hidden
