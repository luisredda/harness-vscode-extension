# Changelog

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Configurable Claude CLI timeout**: New `harness.claudeCliTimeoutSeconds` setting
  - Default: 90s (range: 30-600s)
  - Allows users to increase timeout for complex AI queries requiring many API calls
  - Applied only to Claude CLI subprocess execution (cursor/extension tools unaffected)
- **VS Code Output panel logging**: Centralized logging system with user control
  - All logs now appear in dedicated "Harness" channel (View → Output → Harness)
  - Removed 220+ console.* calls to Developer Tools
  - Timestamp and component prefixes for better readability
  - FME Split.io SDK debug logs now respect `harness.logLevel` setting

### Fixed
- **Streaming ZIP parser for step logs**: Properly handles data descriptors in streaming ZIP files
  - Fixes garbled/unreadable logs for Gitleaks, Wiz SAST, and similar security scanning steps
  - Scans for data descriptor signature (0x08074b50) when compSize=0 in local file header
  - Calculates actual compressed size by locating descriptor or next entry
  - Skips past data descriptor (12 or 16 bytes) after processing each entry
  - Preserves compatibility with standard ZIP files (EOCD-based)
- **UI state management during log fetch**: Loading states now update correctly
  - Added render() calls after STEP_LOGS_LOADING, STEP_LOGS_EMPTY, and STEP_LOGS_OPENED_IN_TAB messages
  - Loading spinner displays immediately when clicking a step
  - Proper "No logs available" state instead of stale content
  - Shows "✓ Logs opened in editor tab" confirmation
- **ANSI escape codes in logs**: Removes color codes and control characters for clean display
  - Created utils/ansiStrip.ts utility to strip ANSI sequences
  - Removes standard ANSI codes (\x1b[...m), OSC sequences, character sets, malformed UTF-8
  - Applied in logEditorTab.ts before rendering in editor tabs

### Changed
- Cleaned up verbose debug logging throughout logService.ts for production readiness
- Logger now initialized with OutputChannel in extension.ts activation
- "Harness: Show Debug Output" and "Harness: Debug FME Flags" commands reference Output panel

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Critical poller stability issues**: Resolved multiple issues causing pipeline updates to stop
  - Added 10-30s timeouts to all network requests to prevent indefinite hangs
  - Implemented re-entrancy guard to prevent concurrent tick() executions
  - Fixed terminal execution behavior: now schedules heartbeat (120s) instead of stopping completely
  - Fixed scheduling logic to keep polling active when detail executions are running
  - Prevented 25-second UI freezes when fetching step logs (now non-blocking)
  - Fixed FME SDK callbacks creating race conditions (now run in background)
  - Fixed log editor tabs stealing sidebar focus and pausing updates (preserveFocus: true)
  - Fixed poller stopping when no matching live execution found (early return scheduling bug)

### Changed
- **Optimized GIT_CONTEXT messaging**: Reduced from every-second spam to only-on-change
  - Extracted to `sendGitContext()` method, only called when git/config/FME changes
  - Removes unnecessary webview re-renders and console noise
- **Removed automatic log streaming**: Logs now fetched only on-demand when user clicks a step
  - Reduces API calls and network traffic
  - Logs still available instantly via on-demand fetch with editor tab display
- **Reduced FME debug logging**: Disabled Split.io debug logs, switched to OPTIMIZED impression mode
  - Cleaner console output focused on application messages

### Documentation
- Added installation instructions for end users in README
  - Installation from GitHub Releases via UI or CLI
  - Clearer distinction between user installation and developer build

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **First-run onboarding empty state**: Beautiful setup UI for new users
  - Shows 3-step preview (Base URL, Personal Access Token, Account ID) before configuration
  - "Start setup" button launches existing onboarding flow
  - No popup interruption on first install - user discovers setup naturally in sidebar
  - Auto-refreshes to normal view after completion (no reload needed)
  - Consistent "Personal Access Token" terminology throughout onboarding
- **Smart polling optimization**: Significant reduction in API calls and resource usage
  - Pauses polling when Harness sidebar is hidden

  - Auto-refresh with fresh data when becoming visible/focused
- **Auto-paste in Claude Code Extension**: Seamless prompt delivery
  - Automatically pastes prompts after opening Claude Code panel
  - Removed manual "Paste Now" button for consistent UX with Cursor
  - 800ms delay for UI focus before auto-paste

### Fixed
- Cursor AI detection now only works when running inside Cursor editor (not VS Code)
  - Prevents opening GitHub Copilot when using Harness AI bar in VS Code
  - Uses `vscode.env.appName` to detect editor context
- Silent handling of fetch requests when extension not configured
  - No more error notifications during first-run experience
  - Empty state UI handles unconfigured state gracefully

### Changed
- **Icon updates**: Official Harness brand assets
  - Icon-only logo (no text) for VS Marketplace compatibility
  - Updated to PNG format (196×196px) for marketplace requirements

### Added
- **Cursor AI integration**: Full support for Cursor editor with official Harness Cursor Plugin
  - Auto-detection of Cursor installation and Harness Plugin
  - OAuth authentication detection for plugin-based MCP
  - Auto-paste functionality for seamless prompt delivery

- **Configurable logging system**: Production-grade log level control
  - New VS Code setting `harness.logLevel` with 5 levels (off/error/warn/info/debug)
  - Centralized logger utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
  - Applied to extension host and pipeline dispatcher modules
  - Default: `info` level (recommended for production)

### Fixed
- AI bar "Thinking..." animation now displays correctly during Claude CLI requests
- AI response scroll position preserved during re-renders (no more jumping to top)
- AI bar state now correctly reflects selected tool (Cursor vs Claude Code)

### Removed
- AIDA root cause analysis API calls (endpoint returns 404, commented out for future re-enable)
- STO vulnerability findings API calls (deferred to future implementation)
- Design handoff assets from repository (`handoff/` directory)

### Changed
