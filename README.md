## ✨ Features

### 🚀 **Real-time Pipeline Monitoring**
Watch your pipelines run with live status updates. Automatic git context detection shows executions for your current branch and commit.

### 📝 **Syntax-Highlighted Logs**
Click any step to open its logs in a dedicated editor tab with full syntax highlighting. Failed steps are instantly highlighted for quick debugging.

### ✅ **One-Click Approvals**
Handle Harness native, Jira, and ServiceNow approval gates directly in your editor. Permission checks happen automatically.

### 🔍 **Smart Search & Filtering**
Browse all pipelines, filter by status, pin favorites, and explore execution history with pagination. Works with or without a git repository.

### 🔁 **Re-run & Abort**
Re-run a finished execution with its original inputs in one click, or abort a running pipeline (Abort All / Mark as Failed) — the action button adapts to the execution's status and the view follows the new run.

### 🧭 **Build, Deploy & Security Tabs**
Drill into an execution with dedicated detail tabs:
- **Build** — repository, branch (and PR), commits, and published image/SBOM artifacts.
- **Deploy** — per-stage services (with manifests) and environments, plus skip reasons.
- **Security** — STO scanner results with per-severity tiles and new-vulnerability deltas, parsed straight from the execution.

### 🤖 **Harness AI Chat**
Ask Harness Intelligence directly in your IDE. Opens in a side-by-side panel with streaming markdown responses, session history, pipeline-context awareness, and MCP connector status — the same experience as the Harness web chat, tuned for developers.

- **⌘⇧H** / **Ctrl+⇧H** to open or focus
- **Ask Harness AI** button in the sidebar footer
- Auto-scopes to the pipeline execution you're viewing (removable context chip)
- Interactive elicitation cards for YAML edits, confirmations, and multi-step forms mid-conversation

### 🔌 **External AI Tools**
Route pipeline questions to **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Cursor AI** with automatic context injection via MCP — one click away from the sidebar footer.

## 📖 How to Use

### Two View Modes

Switch between views using the tabs at the top of the Harness panel:

#### **📋 Pipelines View**
Browse all pipelines in your project:
- 🔍 Search by name
- 📌 Pin favorites to the top
- 🎯 Click any pipeline to see its latest execution
- ✅ Works without a git repository

#### **📊 Executions View**
Browse full execution history:
- 🔀 Filter by status (All / Failed / Passed)
- 🎯 Filter by specific pipeline
- 📄 Paginated (10-15 per page)
- 🔍 Click any execution for full details and on-demand logs

### Working with Executions

**View Pipeline Status**
The extension automatically detects your current git branch and commit, showing the matching pipeline execution. Live updates every 10 seconds during active runs.

**Debug with Logs**
Click any step to open its logs in a new editor tab with syntax highlighting. Failed steps are highlighted in red for quick identification.

**Handle Approvals**
When a pipeline reaches an approval step, **✓ Approve** and **✕ Reject** buttons appear inline. The extension automatically checks if you have permission to approve.

Supported approval types:
- Harness native approvals (user/group permissions)
- Jira approvals (with ticket link)
- ServiceNow approvals (with ticket link)

**View Policy Results**
OPA policy evaluation results appear when configured. Warnings and errors are highlighted with detailed messages.

### Multi-Project Workflows

Working on multiple Harness projects? Use **"Harness: Switch Project (This Workspace)"** to override org/project for specific workspace folders. Your global settings remain unchanged.

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Harness AI Chat (built-in)

The native **Harness AI Chat** panel connects to Harness Intelligence and streams answers beside your code.

**Open it:**
- Keyboard: **⌘⇧H** (macOS) / **Ctrl+⇧H** (Windows/Linux)
- Sidebar footer: click **Ask Harness AI**
- Command Palette: **Harness: Open AI Chat**
- Editor / Cursor Agents Window toolbar (diamond icon)

**What you get:**
- Streaming markdown responses with session history (search, rename, delete past chats)
- Pipeline context chip — auto-follows the execution you're viewing in the sidebar; click **×** to chat without context
- MCP connector pill showing how many external connectors are active for your project
- Interactive elicitation cards when the assistant needs input (confirm YAML, pick options, fill forms)

Works with PAT or environment-variable auth on SaaS and self-hosted instances that expose `/gateway/harness-intelligence/…`.

### External AI Tools

Ask questions about your pipelines using **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, or **Cursor AI** with automatic context injection via MCP.

### Supported AI Tools

**Claude Code** (CLI or Extension)
- Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- **CLI mode**: Fully automated — responses appear directly in Harness sidebar

4. Your Harness credentials are automatically configured
5. Restart Claude Code to activate the MCP server

**For GitHub Copilot:**
1. Install [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) in VS Code
2. Click **Configure MCP** in the AI footer
3. Choose scope (Project or Global):
   - **Project**: `.vscode/mcp.json` in workspace root — shared with team
   - **Global**: Platform-specific path in home folder — personal
4. Restart VS Code to activate the MCP server

**For Cursor:**
1. **Recommended**: Install [Harness Plugin](https://cursor.com/marketplace/harness) in Cursor
   - OAuth authentication — no manual configuration needed
   - Plugin manages MCP connection automatically
2. **Alternative**: Configure local MCP manually (for advanced users)

### Usage

**Harness AI Chat:**
1. Open the panel (**⌘⇧H** or **Ask Harness AI** in the sidebar footer)
2. Type your question — pipeline context is attached automatically when you're viewing an execution
3. Browse past sessions via the overflow menu → **History**

**External AI tools:**
- Click the **⌄** chevron next to **Ask Harness AI** to switch to Claude Code, Copilot, or Cursor
- Or type your question in the AI footer when an external tool is selected
- Tool preference persists across VS Code sessions
- Pipeline context automatically included in every query

**What context gets sent:**
- Pipeline name, status, execution ID
- Harness execution URL

**Example questions:**
- "Why did this pipeline fail?"
- "What changed between this run and the last successful one?"
- "How can I fix the failing test in the build stage?"

### Authentication Methods

**Personal Access Token (PAT)** — Traditional method
1. Run **Harness: Configure API Key**
2. Enter Base URL and PAT
3. Account ID is **automatically extracted** from your PAT (no manual entry needed!)
4. If extraction fails, you'll be prompted to enter it manually
5. Select org/project during onboarding

**Environment Variables** — Passwordless, CI/CD-friendly
1. Set `HARNESS_API_KEY`, `HARNESS_BASE_URL`, `HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID` before launching VS Code
2. Extension auto-detects and uses environment variables
3. MCP config uses environment variable references (for Claude Code) or inherits from process (for GitHub Copilot)
4. Select org/project during onboarding

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Global Settings (apply everywhere)

Run **Harness: Configure API Key** to set:
- `harness.baseUrl` — Your Harness instance URL (default: `https://app.harness.io`)
- `harness.accountIdentifier` — Your account ID (auto-extracted from PAT, or set via environment variable)
- `harness.orgIdentifier` — Default organization
- `harness.projectIdentifier` — Default project

Your Personal Access Token is stored securely in VS Code's secret storage.

**💡 Tip:** The extension automatically extracts your account ID from your PAT during setup, so you typically only need to provide Base URL and PAT.

### Optional Settings

- `harness.pollingIntervalSeconds` — How often to check for updates (default: 10s, min: 5s, max: 120s)
- `harness.defaultView` — Which view opens by default (`pipelines` or `executions`)
- `harness.diffAwareSTO` — Limit STO annotations to files changed in current diff (default: true)
- `harness.logLevel` — Console verbosity: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), `debug`

### Per-Workspace Override

Use **Harness: Switch Project (This Workspace)** to override org/project for specific workspace folders.
